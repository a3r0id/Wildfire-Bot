## What does Wildfire Bot do?
**Wildfire Bot** follows major wildfire incidents, Tweeting live fire cam collages as well as various regional metrics such as satellite imagery, weather conditions and, most importantly, the status of large wildfire incidents.

## Is Wildfire Bot reliable?
**Wildfire Bot** utilizes various official public datasets to curate valuable Tweets pertaining to the status of the current incident/s.
I've focused on accurately posting new updates as they arise but some data my be behind by a few minutes while I'm still polishing things up.

## FAQ

- Q) Why is it still daytime in some of the fire cam imagery while it is actually nighttime in the region that the cam is located in?
- A) Wildfire Bot uses [ALERTwildfire](https://alertwildfire.org)'s public data. Some of their cams do not run at nighttime therefore the last available image is used. Edit: visa-versa as well! Some cams are only FLIR it seems.

- Q) Why did you create Wildfire Bot?
- A) Living in Northern California, wildfires are a common aspect of life. This is my way of fighting back!🤜Wildfire Bot aims to provide factual information for folks keeping an eye on wildfires.

- Q) Are you affiliated with any organization?
- A) Nope, it's just me 👋. I utilize public data from my region's *awesome* official websites/API's to curate the content in real-time, all of which I do not own/represent.
